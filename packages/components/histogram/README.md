# Histogram

Histogram components and utilities.

The `HistogramG` component can be used within an SVG element (its main element being a `g`).

The `HistogramDiv` component can be used within an HTML element (its main element being a `div`) and has the same props of `HistogramG` excluding `width` and `height` and with the addition of `headerHeight`, `padding` and `title`.

[Utilities](packages/components/histogram/src/utils.js) can be useful when binning data.
